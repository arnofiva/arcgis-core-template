# ArcGIS Maps SDK for JavaScript template

## Prerequisites

- Node.js 20.0+

The template comes set up with Prettier for formatting. Take a look at their [editor integration docs](https://prettier.io/docs/en/editors) to integrate it into your development environment.

## Run project locally

To start:

```
npm install
npm run dev
```

Then open your browser at http://localhost:3000/

## Create productive build

```
npm run build
```

The `dist` folder then contains all the files for the web app, also served at `https://arnofiva.github.io/arcgis-core-template`.

In order to use the `gh-pages` approach, see the following instructions. Make sure you remove an existing `dist` folder if it has been created from a previous build.
